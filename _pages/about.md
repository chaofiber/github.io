I am particularly fascinated with research at the intersection of robotics and algorithmic and theoretical techniques (e.g., nonlinear control methods, machine learning, optimization, etc.). I am also interested in the cutting-edge reinforcement learning approaches in the control area.

Besides, I am also interested in photography, travling and so on.
