## GORA-Net: a Temporal Reparameterization Method for Recognizing Actions in Video Sequences

[Gora-net][pdf]

In this project, our object is video of robots which are making some motions. We need to find out what motion the video actually represents. Interestingly, one essentially same motion may be carried by two videos with different temporal distribution. We try to firstly quotient out the temporal fluctuations of the video, which means to make the sequence play speed at a standard time scale. After that, we build a deep learning framework to learn the motion represented by the video. The temporal reparameterization mapping can be regarded as a hidden layer in the recurrent neural network.
