### Abstract

Extracting effective representations from high-dimensional data has been one of the core problems for deep learning. Since the collected data by a reinforcement learning agent are unlabeled, previous reinforcement learning methods learn task-dependent representations in the policy learning process or task-agnostic representations by predicting the future in the pre-training. In robotics tasks, multi-sensory data (e.g., robotic control state and camera observation) are usually accessible and provide abundant multi-source information. In this paper, we present a novel cooperative learning framework to extract effective representations from multi-sensory data. Our framework integrates self-supervised predictive dynamics learning and contrastive synchronization learning, which respectively leverages the dynamics information of each data source and the natural temporal synchronization of multi-source data. We evaluate our method on popular robotic control tasks, and results show that our model learns effective generic representations for down-stream reinforcement learning tasks and enables efficient transfer among multi-sensor data.
