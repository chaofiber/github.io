## a Survey on Robot Learning

[[robot learning](https://about.2cni.com/assets/pdf/survey_rl.pdf)]

In this survey, I want to summarize approaches in robot reinforcement learning. The survey mainly introduced Markov Decision Process based methods including some variants including partially observable Markov Decision Process, Bayesian learning based POMDP, model predictive control approach and KL divergence upper bound based POMDP. Apart from applying other cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning methods, we can also make use of other control methods such model predictive control in robot learning problems.
