One of my photography friend told me this picture looks very German-style because of the low saturation and some others like it because if gives a feeling of background in a artistic movie, which makes me very proud. I especially like this picture and this is also the reason I name it industry & infinity.

The actual view I saw might not as bright as this one I showed here, but I think that is one of the advantage of pictures -- they keep the impression instead of facts.

I also like this one. If I have moved my camera a bit lower and captured a clearer view of the chair, it would be better.
