- TF (Transformation System)
  - Tool for keeping track of coordinate frames over time, matintaiains relationship between coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered in time.
  - Implemented as `publisher/subscriber` model on the ropics `\tf` and `\tf_static`
  - `rosrun tf tf_monitor`: print information about the current transform tree
  - `rosrun tf tf_echo source_frame target_frame`: print information about the transform between two frames
  - `rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py`: create a visual graph of the trainsform tree. (it should be `rosrun rf view_frames` but currently it does not work)
  - `tf_static` publishers publishes transformation that does not change over time. (e.g. if there is no actuators at certain joint)
  - Tranforms are handled in the tfBuffer. `tf2_ros::Buffer tfBuffer;`
  - `try catch` blcok in C++; try to allow some exceptions? 

- rqt User Interface
  - `rosrun rqt_gui rqt_gui` or `rqt`
  - `rosryb rqt_multiplot rqt_multiplot`
  - `rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph`
  - `rqt_console': displaying and filtering ROS messages.
  - 'rqt_logger_level' configuring the logger level of ROS nodes (only displaying info that higher than 'info')

- Robot models (URDF: Unified Robot Description Format)
  - Defines an XML format for representing a root model. It containts three parts:
    - Kinematic and dynamic description
    - Visual representatio (Mesh for visuals, mesh is expensive to model, so we do not want to use this for collision)
    - Collision model (primitives for collsion)
    - SDF (an easier description for simulation models, gezebo translate urdf to sdf) for gazebo.
