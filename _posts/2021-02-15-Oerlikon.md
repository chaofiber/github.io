On a beautiful afternoon, I went to Oerlikon to pick up the gift for my girlfriend. After sticking at home for too long, the sunlight saved my life. It was my first time trying to take street pictures. Finding spots which are both interesting is a funny process because you notice something that you won't notice if it isn't for the picture.
